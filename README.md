# CryptoBot

A simple Telegram bot that shows real-time cryptocurrency prices using the Binance API.

The bot displays a list of popular coins, allows users to select a coin via inline buttons, and fetches the current USDT price with basic caching to reduce API requests.

This project is created **purely for my personal portfolio**.  
It does not represent a production-ready or commercial solution and will be updated over time.
